# Google-Books-Search

## Description
A web application that interacts with the Google Books API to display books by the user, which can be saved
via Mongoose/MongoDB. Employs React-Router to display two pages: One to view saved books, and one to search books. 

## Usage

input section, then click on the Search button.
* To save or view the book, click the corresponding button. 
* To view your saved books, click the **Saved** tab, where you can view/delete a book by clicking corresponding button.
